# How computing works?
Computers are machines that process data

Instructions and data are stored in the computer memory

Data is stored by using variables

# Variables
A **variable** is a container of information:
```python
first_name = "John"
``` 

* The information can be changed at any time
```python
first_name = "John"
first_name = "Peter"
``` 
* In Python programming variables are used all the time

**Variables** provide means for:

* **Storing** information
* **Retrieving** stored info
* **Modifying** stored info

Variables are characterized by:

* **name** (identifier)
* **type** (of the information preserved)
* **value** (stored information)

Defining a variable
```python
age = 25
# variable name
# variable value (type: integer)
```
